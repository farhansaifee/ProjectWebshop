# ProjectWebshop
In this Project we will be creating a Webshop as a part of our studies at the UAS Technikum Vienna.

Our team consists of the following 5 people:\
Project lead of students:
* Mohammad Farhan Saifee

Project members:
* Malik Yawar Awan
* Burhan Coskun
* Yang Li Fu
* Seyedamirreza Sepehrihosseini

## Tools
In order to execute this project in an easier way is by using specific software tools.
So here's a list of software tools which we are going to apply to our project:
* Github
* MS Azure
* Google Drive

### Github
Github makes it easier for everyone to stay up to date. And the most important thing is: You don't have to send your changes to everyone else. Through Github every team member is able to download the current or the latest status of the project and they are even able to work parallel.

### MS Azure
Here we basically define our Requirements, Sprints, etc.

### Google Drive
We use Google Drive for example for our Time recording for this project.
